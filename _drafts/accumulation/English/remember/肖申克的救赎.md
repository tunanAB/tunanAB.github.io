you are right

Salvation lies within

救赎之道，就在其中

I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

Get busing living or get busy dying.

Lord, it's a miracle





You feel you've been rehabiliated?

Rehabiliated?          

well, now, let me see.

I don't have any idea what that means.

It means you're ready to rejoin society

I know what you think it means, sonny.

To me it's just a made-up word.

A politician's word so that young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

What do you really want to know?

Am I sorry for what I did?

well, are you?

There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

I look back on the way I was then 

a young stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

I want to talk to him.

I want to try and talk some sense to him.

Tell him the way things are.

But I can't.

That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left.

I got to live with that.

Rehabilitated?

It's just a bullshit word.

So you go on and stamp your forms sonny, and stop wasting my time.  

Because to tell you the truth I don't give a shit.

But I tell you these walls are funny.

First you hate them.

Then you get used to them.

Enough times passes, you get so you depend on them.

That's "institutionalized."



From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
