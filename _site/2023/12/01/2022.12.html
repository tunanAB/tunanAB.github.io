<p>In addition , participants had blood test at the start and finish of each new diet.</p>

<p>Further ,both diets increase blood cholesterol levels compared with the diet built on vegetarian protein sources.</p>

<p>The team acknowledged that it is possible that white meal is better for our health than red meal despite their finding.</p>

<p>This is because other effects of red meat consumption could contribute to heart disease independent of cholesterol.</p>
