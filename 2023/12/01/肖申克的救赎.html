<p>you are right</p>

<p>Salvation lies within</p>

<p>救赎之道，就在其中</p>

<p>I guess it comes down to a simple choice.</p>

<p>Get busing living or get busy dying.</p>

<p>Lord, it’s a miracle</p>

<p>You feel you’ve been rehabiliated?</p>

<p>Rehabiliated?</p>

<p>well, now, let me see.</p>

<p>I don’t have any idea what that means.</p>

<p>It means you’re ready to rejoin society</p>

<p>I know what you think it means, sonny.</p>

<p>To me it’s just a made-up word.</p>

<p>A politician’s word so that young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.</p>

<p>What do you really want to know?</p>

<p>Am I sorry for what I did?</p>

<p>well, are you?</p>

<p>There’s not a day goes by I don’t feel regret.</p>

<p>Not because I’m in here or because you think I should.</p>

<p>I look back on the way I was then</p>

<p>a young stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.</p>

<p>I want to talk to him.</p>

<p>I want to try and talk some sense to him.</p>

<p>Tell him the way things are.</p>

<p>But I can’t.</p>

<p>That kid’s long gone and this old man is all that’s left.</p>

<p>I got to live with that.</p>

<p>Rehabilitated?</p>

<p>It’s just a bullshit word.</p>

<p>So you go on and stamp your forms sonny, and stop wasting my time.</p>

<p>Because to tell you the truth I don’t give a shit.</p>

<p>Zihuatanejo</p>

<p>But I tell you these walls are funny.</p>

<p>First you hate them.</p>

<p>Then you get used to them.</p>

<p>Enough times passes, you get so you depend on them.</p>

<p>That’s “institutionalized.”</p>

<p>From now on, I’ll write two letters a week instead of one.</p>
