<p>Quit, don’t  quit.</p>

<p>Noodles, don’t noodles.</p>

<p>You are too concerned with what was and what will be.</p>

<p>There’s a saying:</p>

<p>Yesterday is <a href="/ˈhɪstri/">history</a>, tomorrow is a <a href="/ˈmɪstəri/">mystery</a></p>

<p>but today is a gift.</p>

<p>That is why it is called the present.</p>
